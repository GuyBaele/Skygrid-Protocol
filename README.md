# Skygrid-Protocol
Input and output files accompanying the Skygrid protocol paper

The folder **1.iqtree** contains the following input files for IQ-TREE:
* first\_200\_SLE.fasta: multiple sequence alignment containing the first 200 Ebolavirus sequences from Sierra Leone
* partitions.nex: NEXUS file (without any genetic data) delimiting the various partitions within the alignment
All other files within the folder are output files generated by IQ-TREE, with the **.treefile** containing the maximum-likelihood phylogeny.

The folder **2.beauti** contains two NEXUS files with genetic data, after removing 4 sequences in the preceding TempEst analysis:
* first\_196\_SLE\_CDS.nex: multiple sequence alignment for the coding region
* first\_196\_SLE\_IG.nex: multiple sequence alignment for the aggregated intergenic regions
These 2 files need to be imported into BEAUti in order to setup the various model components for the BEAST analysis.

The folder **3.beast** contains the BEAST XML file that was generated using BEAUti.

Finally, the folder **4.tracer** contains the output files of 2 independent BEAST analyses of the generated XML file:
* BEAST\_100m\_run.1.log: first replicate of the BEAST analysis, with starting seed 1234
* BEAST\_100m\_run.2.log: second replicate of the BEAST analysis, with starting seed 1552563115304
These files need to be loaded into Tracer in order to assess convergence and proper mixing of the analyses, as well as determining burn-in.
Note that we here do not provide the **.trees** files generated during the BEAST analysis, as these are not needed to reconstruct the past population dynamics using the Skygrid model.
